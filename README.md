# 👋 Hi, I'm Shuchi Chitrakar

I'm a data science enthusiast with a strong academic foundation in Physics and hands-on experience in **technical writing**, **data analysis**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. My work bridges technical depth with clear communication—specializing in topics like **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **analytics**.

Over the past year, I’ve developed and documented data-driven insights while honing my skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI. Now, I’m transitioning into more hands-on roles in data science, with a growing focus on **finance** and **quantitative research**.
